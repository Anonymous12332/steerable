# Algebraic approach to CNN steerability
This is an anonimous repository for the conference submission that contains the code for the experiments on steerable network architectures.

The entry point is the notebook train_notebook.ipynb

It contains:
- The links to the Lines and Squares datasets
- The sample code to initialize GCNN with parameterized kernel on top of it
- The code to lauch training on the selected dataset with selected equivariance level and augmentation
